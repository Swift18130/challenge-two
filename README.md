Challenge Two





USER STORY 
AS AN employerI WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samplesSO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous workWHEN I load their portfolioTHEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact themWHEN I click one of the links in the navigationTHEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding sectionWHEN I click on the link to the section about their workTHEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applicationsWHEN I am presented with the developer's first applicationTHEN that application's image should be larger in size than the othersWHEN I click on the images of the applicationsTHEN I am taken to that deployed applicationWHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devicesTHEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport



NOTES
I tried to pull from the activity examples on how to do this. I was able to use the example of a header, and use my resources to get the hyperlinks going. The foot was fairlt easy and it was interesting learning the the copyright symbol can be created using code. 

I still need more help masterinf resposive screens and creating containers so that the position of objects don't move as much. I will resubmit if I'm allowed to.
